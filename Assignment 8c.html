<h2>Ambitions</h2>
</div>

<p> As someone who has moved numerous times between states, change became a regular expectation in my life. I aspire to create work that can contribute
  a positive impact with everyone I come across. With my studies covering business, marketing, foreign studies, journalism, management, and
  communications, I plan to invest my energy and motivation towards one (or more) of the following fluctuating fields:

</p>

<div class="list">
<ul>
  <li>Makeup Design</li>
  <li>Cosmetic Market Analysis</li>
  <li>Social Media Management</li>
  <li>Event Planning</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
</div>

<div class="interest">
<p>I am an avid lover of any activity that insights a challenge of confidence, intelligence, <br>
  and / or trust with one's own self. In high school, I enjoyed competing in various events <br>
  in DECA such as Fashion Merchandising and Hospitality and Tourism. Currently, <br>I am an
active member of UNC's Boxing Club and the university's <br>Caribbean Student Association. Some
of my hobbies outside of my extracurriculars<br>include embroidery, studying world languages,
roaming (safely) around the Research <br>Triangle area, listening to music, and meditating.</p>
